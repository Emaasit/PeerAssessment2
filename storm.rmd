Introduction  
-------------

Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

Data  
----

The data for this assignment came in the form of a comma-separated-value file compressed via the bzip2 algorithm to reduce its size. I download the file from the course web site including some documentation of the database. The two documentations listed below show how some of the variables are constructed/defined.

-National Weather Service Storm Data Documentation

-National Climatic Data Center Storm Events FAQ

The events in the database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011. In the earlier years of the database there are generally fewer events recorded, most likely due to a lack of good records. More recent years are more or less complete.

Assignment
----------

The basic goal of this assignment was to explore the NOAA Storm Database and answer some basic questions about severe weather events. I used the database to answer the questions below and the code for my entire analysis is also showed below. My analysis consists of tables, figures, and other summaries. I used a combination of several R packages to support my analysis.

###Questions   

My data analysis addressed the following questions:

-Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?

-Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?
